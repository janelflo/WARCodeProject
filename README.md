# WARCodeProject
Replicate the card game WAR using Object Oriented Programming in Javascript

Using Object Oriented Programming, I created a basic version of the card game WAR. 
I composed my code into Classes and created Objects of those classes to run my card game in the Console.
My next module in school is on front-end technologies, so I plan to expand on this game as I develop my styling skills.
